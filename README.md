# git_clone_issue

This extension add "Clone" button on the issues. On click will open the new issue form populated with the original issue data.
It can also provide "Clone" button on the issues list and generate new issues based on predefined templates (templates.json). I know github templates system, but for my use case I needed too mane templates for my client to be comfortable... And I guess I'm not the only one with that problem.

To use it on GitHub Entrerprise versions edit the manifest.json file and replace https://github.com with the base url of your repository.

Set options clicking on the extension icon and selecting options... quite simple.

Adapt it to your needs and fix what you don't like, it's really bad code, unproperly formatted and far from a "good browser extension", but it works and do what if have to do (most of the times :D).
