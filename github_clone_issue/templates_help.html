  <p>Templates are defined using json files. E.g</p>
  <pre>
{
  "id": "Weekly security",
  "title": "Week X security review. Week X.",
  "body": "### Request\r\nThe secury alerts detected by the proces...",
  "labels": ["secutity","pendingDev"],
  "assignees": ["mpereram-external","miguelsvq"]
}
  </pre>
  <p>To add a template, select a json file from your computer and it will be readed and added. To edit a template just need to use a json file with the same "id" value, and will overwrite the previous version.</p>
  <p>The id value is the value shown in the "New from template" links list.</p>
